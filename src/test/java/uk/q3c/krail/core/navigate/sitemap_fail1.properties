# File format version 4.0
# This section identifies all the packages which may contain views.  The most efficient use is to identify 
# only the root package(s) here, and qualify with sub-packages in the map section
# syntax is like this:  uk.q3c.app.views
[viewPackages]
uk.q3c.krail.core.view
fixture.testviews2

[options]
# The fully qualified name of the enum class to use for label keys




# if true, 'View' is appended to all view names in the tree - just makes things a it more readable
appendView=false
