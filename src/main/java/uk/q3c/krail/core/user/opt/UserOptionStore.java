public interface UserOptionStore {

    /**
     * Loads an {@code Optional<T>} option value from the store, or {@link Optional#absent()}} is no valid value found (including a situation where the type stored cannot be cast to the type to be loaded)
     *
     * @param sampleValue
     *         this is used only for typing the return value, it is not a default value as with other parts of the
     *         UserOption API
     * @param layerId
     *         represents a layer in a hierarchy of options - these are prefixed with a numeral indicating the level
     *         of the layer (for example, a user id might be "0:dsowerby").  Layer 0 is always the user layer, and
     *         layer 99 is always the system layer and both are always available.  There may or may not be other
     *         layers in between.  An implementation ensures that the hierarchy is honoured so that the highest layer
     *         with a specific option value overrides any values for the same option at lower layers. For example, a
     *         user layer option will always override the same option defined at the system layer.
     * @param consumerClassName
     *         the class name of an implementation of UserOptionConsumer which uses a specific option.  For example
     *         OrderInputForm
     * @param key
     *         the option specific key, for example SHOW_ALL_SECTIONS
     * @param qualifiers
     *         optional, this is usually dynamically generated qualifier(s) to make a complete unique identity where
     *         the same option may be used several times within a consumer.  If for example you have an array of
     *         dynamically generated buttons, which you want the user to be able to individually choose the colours
     *         of, you may have consumer=com.example.FancyButtonForm, key=BUTTON_COLOUR, qualifiers="2,3"
     *         <p>
     *         where "2,3" is the grid position of the button
     * @param <T>
     *         a type determined by the sampleValue.  An implementation should assume that an object of any type can be
     *         passed.       *
     *
