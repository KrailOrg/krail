 * The base for the resource bundle of {@link Labels}. The separation between them is arbitrary, but helps break down

 * <li>{@link Labels} : short, usually one or two words, no parameters, generally used as captions
 * <li>{@link Descriptions} : longer, typically several words, no parameters, generally used in tooltips
 * <li>{@link Messages} : contains parameters, typically used for user messages.
