     * For class and property file readers, auto-stubbing will only occur if a bundle is found, but there is no entry
     * for the key.  If the bundle is not found, then no stubbing will occur.  Note also that for these types of
     * readers, stubbing is transient, as it is not possible to write directly back to source.  You can however use
     * {@link PatternUtility} to write the bundle out to another location.
     * <p>
     * Other reader implementations (database for example) should be able to write the stub back to persistence
