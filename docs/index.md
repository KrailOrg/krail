# Welcome

Welcome to the Krail Tutorial.  It is definitely better to work through the Tutorial in sequence, but if you want to skip a step, you will find a link at the end of each chapter so that you can clone each stage from a GitHub repository.
 
There is also a developers guide, but to be honest that is more like a collection of rough notes at the moment, until I can find time to write it properly.

**Please note:  This tutorial is based on the Vaadin 7 version of Krail - it should still be possible to follow it, but it will not be updated until the move to Eclipse Vert.x is done (or fails!)**

Please do give feedback, whether it is something you do like or something you do not like.


Enjoy
