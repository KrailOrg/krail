# Sitemap

The Krail Sitemap describes, as you would expect, the structure of the application. However, it is not just a passive output from a site, but an integral part of the application design - it brings together a route, its associated View and an I18N key for translating the page title. 

# View

A View is almost as described in the Vaadin handbook - the only difference with a ```KrailView```, as opposed to a standard Vaadin View, is that is modified to work with Krail's Guice enabled navigation.

# URI
Of course there is only one correct definition of 'URI', but in a Krail context it is the way the structure of the URI is interpreted which becomes important.  This interpretation is defined by an implementation of ```URIFragmentHandler```, and Krail's default implementation is ```StrctURIFragmentHandler```.  See the javadoc for that class for a definition of how it separates 'pages' from parameters.

As Krail has evolved, the terminology used to describe various elements of a URI has become a bit confused.  This section sets out how it should be - but at the moment, other documentation (and method / field naming) are inconsistent.  Hopefully the planned move to Vert.x will not change anything further

By example:

URI         - **com.example.myapp/#members/detail/id=1** - the whole thing<br>
baseUri     - **com.example.myapp/**#members/detail/id=1<br>
fragment    - com.example.myapp/#**members/detail/id=1**<br>
route       - com.example.myapp/#**members/detail**/id=1 - this assumes the use of ```StrctURIFragmentHandler``` to define parameters<br>
parameters  - com.example.myapp/#members/detail/**id=1**
