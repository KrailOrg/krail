This document aims to assist the Krail developer to understand how to
develop an application based on Krail, by dipping in and out of features
as required.

A `Tutorial <tutorial/intro.md>`__ is available to walk through the
process, step by step.

If you are are interested in the reasons for some of the development
decisions made in Krail, take a look at the `Developer
Guide <devguide/intro.md>`__ - but be aware that it may well be out of
date.
