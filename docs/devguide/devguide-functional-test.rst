==================
Functional Testing
==================

For a functional test, exercised through the user interface, it is
likely you would want to use one of the tools designed for just that
purpose. Currently these would most likely be one of:

-  Vaadin TestBench

-  Selenide

-  Selenium

Vaadin TestBench is obviously Vaadin aware, but has a licence cost.
Selenide is free and open source. Both use Selenium underneath to remove
some of the issues of testing in an AJAX environment.

Component Ids
=============

All the above tools provide various methods of detecting an element
within a web page. The most robust is to use a CSS Selector, which in
Vaadinâ€™s case is provided by a ``Component.id``

To assist testing, Krail automatically assigns a hierarchical id to
selected components. This is done by an implementation of
``ComponentIdGenerator``

This id is in the form of
*MyView-component-nestedcomponent-nestedcomponent* to whatever depth is
defined by your views and components. By default, anything which
implements ``Layout`` is ignored, as these do not usually declare any
components, and are not usually required for functional testing.

You can, however, use **@AssignComponentId** annotation to change this

Affect on Performance
---------------------

Using CSS selectors makes robust testing through the UI a lot easier,
but does have the penalty of incurring additional network traffic for
all the extra labels, which you might not want in a production
environment - though if performance is not an issue, they could also be used for application monitoring.

There is an outstanding `issue <https://github.com/davidsowerby/krail/issues/662>`__ to make it
possible to switch this feature off via configuration.

Page Loading
============
One of the problems with automated testing is knowing when a page is ready to be tested.
A ``PageLoading`` message is despatched on the ``MessageBus`` as the transition from one page to another is started, followed by a ``Page Ready`` message once the page has been built and data has been loaded.

In ``SimpleUI``, the ``PageReady`` message is used to set the title in the ``NavigationBar`` - this can be used as a signal that the page is ready for testing.

Functional Test Support
=======================

VaadinTestBench has been replaced by `Selenide <http://selenide.org/>`__
for Functional Testing. This solution is not as complete as TestBench,
but covers many use cases.

Component ids are now generated automatically to support functional
testing.

A ``FunctionalTestSupport`` object provides a model of route to View /
UI, and the components they contain.

To complement this, there is some early but useful work held currently
in the test-app project which generates Page Objects for functional
testing. These, along with some framework code, enable testing using
Selenide, and could be extended easily for use with Vaadin TestBench -
the objective it to enable the use of different test tools without
changing the tests

See ``KotlinPageObjectGenerator`` and the other classes in
uk.q3c.krail.functest, in the `test-app <https://github.com/davidsowerby/krail-testApp>`__ project

The code behind this will eventually become a separate library.
