# Introduction

This Tutorial will take you through some of the basic steps of getting an application up and running, quickly, with Krail.

Krail encourages prototyping, by providing a lot of default functionality so that you can see early results.  Most of that functionality can then be modified or replaced.  The aim is to give the Krail developer the best of both worlds - quick results, but still the freedom to modify things however they wish.
