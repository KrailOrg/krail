# 1. Install pandoc from http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/
# 2. Copy this script into the directory containing the .md files
# 3. Ensure that the script has execute permissions
# 4. Run the script
#
# By default this will keep the original .md file

FILES=*.xml
for f in $FILES
do
  # extension="${f##*.}"
  filename="${f%.*}"
  echo "Converting $f to $filename.rst"
  `pandoc $f -f docbook -t rst -o $filename.rst`
  # uncomment this line to delete the source file.
  # rm $f
