= Welcome

This documentation is in 3 parts

* Tutorial. As you would expect, this is a step by step Tutorial.
* User Guide. Notes on how to do things, collated by feature
* Developer Guide. Notes on why things are done the way they are. In truth, this is really a loose collection of technical notes optimistically called a "developer guide"

Please do give feedback, whether it is something you do like or something you do not like.

Enjoy
